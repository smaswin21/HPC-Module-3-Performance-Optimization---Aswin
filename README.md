## Project Title: Performance Optimization and Parallel Computing Exercise

### Overview

This project focuses on optimizing and parallelizing a Python program that performs a large-scale simulation of a physical system involving intensive matrix operations. The aim is to improve the performance and scalability of the code while ensuring correctness and efficient memory usage.

## Problem Statement

The original Python program is slow and not optimized for multi-core systems. It performs the following operations:

There is a Python program that performs a large-scale simulation of a physical system. The program involves intensive matrix operations, including matrix multiplication, element-wise operations, and solving linear equations. 
The current implementation is slow and not optimized for running on multi-core systems.
